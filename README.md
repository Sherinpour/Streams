The project starts by using OAuth-based authentication to enable the user to login using Google API. The home screan displays a list of videos the user can stream alone with an 'Edit' and 'Delete' button to enble the user edit or delete videos they created. There is also a 'Create Stream' button that enables the user to create new streams. The project makes use of a vast variety of libraries.
